    "en": "APL solution for Longest Consecutive. Uses grade (⍋/⍒) for sorting - returns indices that would sort the array. Uses reduction (/) to aggregate values: +/ sums, ×/ multiplies, ⌈/ finds max, ⌊/ finds min. Uses scan (\\) to compute running operations: +\\ is running sum, ×\\ is running product, ⌈\\ is running max, ⌊\\ is running min. Uses tally (≢) to count array length. Implementation uses APL's array-oriented primitives for concise expression.",
