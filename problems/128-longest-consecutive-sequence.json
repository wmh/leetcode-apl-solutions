    "en": "APL solution for Longest Consecutive Sequence. Uses grade (⍋/⍒) for sorting - returns indices that would sort the array. Uses reduction (/) to aggregate values: +/ sums, ×/ multiplies, ⌈/ finds max, ⌊/ finds min. Uses unique (∪) to remove duplicate elements. Implementation uses APL's array-oriented primitives for concise expression.",
