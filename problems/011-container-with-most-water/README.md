## 🟡 Difficulty: Medium

## Problem

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## 💡 APL Solution

```apl
MaxArea ← {⌈/,((⍵∘.⌊⍵)×(⍳≢⍵)∘.-⍳≢⍵)}
```

## 📝 Explanation

APL solution for Container With Most Water. Uses outer product (∘.) to create matrix of all pair combinations. Uses reduction (/) to aggregate values: +/ sums, ×/ multiplies, ⌈/ finds max, ⌊/ finds min. Uses tally (≢) to count array length. Uses iota (⍳) to generate index ranges or find element positions. Implementation uses APL's array-oriented primitives for concise expression.
