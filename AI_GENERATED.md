# ⚠️ AI Generated Content Disclaimer

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project was created with significant assistance from AI (Claude by Anthropic). The following components were AI-generated or AI-assisted:

### Fully AI-Generated Components

1. **Project Structure & Architecture**
   - Complete project layout and file organization
   - Modular design pattern for problem files
   - Multi-language support system architecture

2. **Source Code**
   - `index.html` - Complete web interface
   - `js/app.js` - Core application logic
   - `i18n.js` - Internationalization system
   - All utility scripts (generate_problems.py, etc.)

3. **APL Solutions**
   - All APL code implementations
   - Algorithm explanations
   - Complexity analysis

4. **Documentation**
   - README files (all language versions)
   - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - GETTING_STARTED.md
   - This AI_GENERATED.md file

5. **Problem Content**
   - Problem descriptions (7 languages)
   - Solution explanations (7 languages)
   - All translations

6. **Configuration Files**
   - GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/pages.yml)
   - .gitignore
   - LICENSE

### Human Contributions

- Project requirements and specifications
- Design direction and feature requests
- Final review and approval
- Repository ownership and maintenance

## 📝 Content Accuracy

**Important Notes:**

1. **APL Code Verification**: While the APL solutions are syntactically structured according to APL conventions, they have NOT been tested in an actual APL interpreter (Dyalog APL, GNU APL, etc.). Users should verify and test all code before using in production.

2. **Algorithm Correctness**: The algorithms are based on well-known LeetCode solutions, but specific APL implementations may require adjustments for actual execution.

3. **Translations**: All 7 language translations were AI-generated. Native speakers should review and correct any linguistic errors or awkward phrasing.

4. **Problem Descriptions**: Problem descriptions are paraphrased from LeetCode. Users should refer to official LeetCode for authoritative problem statements.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Copyright & Licensing

- **Original Problems**: LeetCode problems are property of LeetCode LLC
- **APL Solutions**: Original implementations under MIT License
- **This Project**: MIT License (see LICENSE file)
- **Fair Use**: This project is for educational purposes

### Attribution

This project acknowledges:
- **LeetCode**: For providing the original algorithm problems
- **Anthropic Claude**: For AI-assisted code generation
- **APL Community**: For the APL programming language and resources
- **Kenneth E. Iverson**: Creator of APL

## 🔍 Verification Recommendations

Before using this project, users should:
